The retail dataset we have on hand is composed of sales information from an online store that operates throughout the national territory, selling products from different departments. Additionally, the store operates through different sales channels, such as marketplace, own store, among others.

Business assumptions: When analyzing the data, it is important to keep in mind that there are some business assumptions that must be considered. The first one is that, due to an error in the system, some purchases do not have UF (Federative Unit) information. To solve this problem, it was decided that these purchases will be considered as belonging to the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS). The second assumption is that the final price of a product cannot be higher than the price with shipping.

Metrics: Based on this context and the established business assumptions, we can evaluate the following metrics:

Best-selling departments: By analyzing sales data, we can identify which departments are most popular among customers. This information can be useful to understand which products are most sought after by customers and adjust the store's sales strategy accordingly.
Average price with shipping by Department Name: To understand price behavior by department, we can calculate the average price with shipping by department name. This metric can help identify which departments are most profitable and adjust product pricing according to the desired profit margin.
Quantity of sales per Month: By analyzing the quantity of sales made in each month, we can identify seasonalities in customer buying behavior and plan specific marketing campaigns for each period.
Average income for each type of sales channel: Identifying the average income of customers in different sales channels can help the store adapt its marketing and sales strategy for each target audience.
Average age of customers by brand: Knowing the age range of customers by brand can help identify cons.
